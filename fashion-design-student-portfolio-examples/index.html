For job interviews, it is important to show a mix of technical sketches, real life projects, sewing and patternmaking examples, autocad and photoshop skills. For example, at griffith college, applicants must submit a general art portfolio for review before their application for our ba (hons) in fashion design, ba (hons) in interior architecture or ba (hons) in design communications is considered, while other colleges set specific guidelines or briefs to be fulfilled before applying. Each of our fashion portfolio examples is loaded with beautiful and eye catching design that will be sure to grab a potential employer’s attention.
