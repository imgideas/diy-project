<p>I personally would electrical tape it and never think of it again. 3ds charger cord got chewed apart would it be safe just to tape back together and keep using it or should i just get a new one? Just cut off about an inch from the chewed area from both sides. In your case, if the charger is still working for you, i would wrap a thin layer of electrical tape.</p>
