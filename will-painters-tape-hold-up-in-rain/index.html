This painter�s tape holds up in challenging weather conditions like sun, wind, humidity and rain. Ideally it shouldn’t rain for a few days after you’ve sprayed to give your deck time to cure but most stains will dry quickly and be able to hold up to rain in a matter of hours. The scotchbluepainter’ss tape can be used to tape glass like on your window panes, metal, lightly. When normal tapes get wet, they swell up and lose their adhesion.
